## Development

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools (like
[Bower][] and [BrowserSync][]). You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in package.json.

    npm install

We use [Gulp][] as our build system. Install the Gulp command-line tool globally with:

    npm install -g gulp

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

    ./mvnw
    gulp

Bower is used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in `bower.json`. You can also run `bower update` and `bower install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `-h` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `bower update -h`.


## Building for production

To optimize the Requireris client for production, run:

    ./mvnw -Pprod clean package

This will concatenate and minify CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references
these new files.

To ensure everything worked, run:

    java -jar target/*.war

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.
